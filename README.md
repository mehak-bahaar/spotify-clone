# Spotify Clone

A simple web application that mimics the basic functionality of Spotify, allowing users to play, stop, and change the playback position of songs. This project served as a learning experience to improve JavaScript skills and gain a better understanding of DOM manipulation.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

1. **Play/Pause Button:** Allows users to play or pause the currently selected song.
2. **Seek Bar:** Enables users to change the playback position of the song by dragging a seek bar.
3. **Song List:** Displays a list of songs that users can choose from to play.

## Challenges Faced

- **DOM Manipulation:** Understanding and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the user interface based on user interactions.
- **Event Handling:** Implementing event listeners and handling user actions such as clicks and drags.
- **Playback Control:** Managing the state of the playback (playing or paused) and syncing it with the UI.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-clone.git
